# Comp115_Assignment2
My code for the second assignment in Python course Comp 115 at Capilano University. The assignment requires students to draw an image using the Turtle module.

Running the file opens a drawing window and draws first the night sky background and then the six stars of the Libra constellation - please note it takes several minutes for the drawing to be complete.
