# Comp115_Assignment2
My code for the second assignment in Python course Comp 115 at Capilano University. The assignment requires students to draw an image using the Turtle module; I drew a night sky featuring my zodiac sign. 

Running the file opens a drawing window and draws first the night sky background and then the six stars of the Libra constellation - please note it takes several minutes for the drawing to be complete.
